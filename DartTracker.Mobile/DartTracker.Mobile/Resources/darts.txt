Darts is a sport in which two or more players throw small missiles, also known as darts, at a circular target, known as a "dartboard".[2]. Points can be scored in the game by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though, unlike sports such as Archery, these are randomly allocated throughout the board and do not follow a common principle of points increasing towards the centre of the board. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.
